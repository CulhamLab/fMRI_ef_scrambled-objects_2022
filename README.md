## Summary
  Allows the user to view stereo photo images using their PC Oculus virtual reality headset.
## Installation
  1. Clone the repository to your computer
  2. Copy the Photo Viewer VR X.X.X.zip to some other location on your system (ex. Desktop)
  3. Extract the project files
  4. Open the folder, and double click the Photo Viewer VR application
  5. A window should appear with a VR view
NOTE! Do not push the extracted Photo Viewer VR files to the repo.  This is the reason for extracting them to another location on your computer.
## Usage
### Loading Photos
  1. Close your application if it is running
  2. Navigate to the 'Images' directory located in the Photo Viewer VR folder you extracted. The path to the images folder is as such:
  <Some location on your system>\Photo Viewer VR\Photo Viewer VR_Data\StreamingAssets\Images\<Your custom directories with your images here>
  3. Create a folder and place your images in there, or just put your images into the 'Default' directory
  NOTE!  You can load photos while the application is running, but you will need to press the 'Refresh' button for the application to find them
### Changing Photos
  1. You can change your active photo directory with the folder drop down.  This dropdown will contain all subdirectories within the 'Images' folder.
  2. The L-Eye (Left Eye) and R-Eye (Right Eye) drop downs contain a list of all images found in the current subdirectory set by the 'Folder' drop down.  Use this for setting what image each eye sees.
  3. Press the left or right arrow keys to change stereo pairs quickly in the scene.
  NOTE!  You can view 2D images by setting the same image to each eye.  
### Changing the Virtual Screen
  1. 'Distance' sets how far away the screen is from the user
  2. 'Height' sets how tall the screen is in respect to the set aspect ration.  Width is automcatically calculated in respect to these two values.
  3. Ratio is a the aspect ratio of the screen.  
### Changing the Background Colour
  1. You can change the background color by selecting somewhere in the color square.  Will be eventually updated to allow for a wider colour palette.
